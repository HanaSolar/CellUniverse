Cell Universe
=============

Tracks the movement of cells from a video source. Currently the code has only been verified to work in 2D, with bacteria-shaped cells. More to come. Our first paper can be found at https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4893/15/2/51, and the PDF is available is available in the top directory of the repo.

Once you clone the repo onto your machine, you should test if Cell Universe is working on your system by installing the requirements and running the script `./regression-test-all.sh`.

Prerequisites:
-----------
Requires Python 3.7+.
https://www.python.org/getit/

Requires Pip.
https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/quickstart/

Quickstart:

1. Install Pipenv
```bash
$ pip install pipenv
```

2. Install required packages using Pipenv
```bash
$ pipenv install
```
This will create a virtual environment with all the required Python packages

3. Activate Pipenv environment
```bash
$ pipenv shell
```

3. Run Cell Universe on an example video (look inside the `run.sh` script to see the command used).
```bash
$ cd examples/canonical && ./run.sh
```

-----------
Alternative:

1. (Optional) Create a Python 3 virtual environment.
```bash
$ pip3 install virtualenv
$ virtualenv -p python3 venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
```
2. Install the requirements.
```bash
(venv)$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run Cell Universe on an example video (look inside the `run.sh` script to see the command used).
```bash
(venv)$ cd examples/canonical && ./run.sh
```

Steps to get a new video running:
---------------------------------
1. Separate your video into still images, one image per frame and put them in a directory with chronological names like `frame000.png`, `frame001.png`, etc.
2. Cell Universe needs a starting "guess" for the number, location, size, and orientation of the cells in the first frame. You can do this visually using the cell labeling tool Python program. This will create an initial properties file with all that information. See the `tools/cell_labeling_tool/README.md` for more information about the cell labeling tool and `examples/canonical/initial.csv` for an example initial properties file generated by the cell labeling tool.
```bash
(venv)$ python3 tools/cell_labeling_tool/cell_labeling_tool.py
```
3. Create a Cell Universe config file and fill it in with settings that fits your cell video. See `examples/canonical/global_optimizer_config.json` (and the comments in the file) and other config JSON files in the `examples` directory for examples.
    * It is important to change settings in the config file like the "Global Setttings" and the "Bacilli Settings" to match your cell video, or else Cell Universe will not function properly.
4. Run Cell Universe, giving it the input directory containing the frames, the initial properties file created above, the config file, as well as the other required arguments (see in the Usage section).
    * An example command is at the bottom of this README and more in the `run.sh` script files in the `examples` directory.

There are several examples in subdirectories below the directory `regression-tests` and `examples`.
