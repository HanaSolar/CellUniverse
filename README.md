Cell Universe
=============

Tracks the movement of cells from a video source. Currently the code has only been verified to work in 2D, with bacteria-shaped cells. More to come. Our first paper can be found at https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4893/15/2/51, and the PDF is available is available in the top directory of the repo.

Once you clone the repo onto your machine, you should test if Cell Universe is working on your system by installing the requirements and running the script `./regression-test-all.sh`.

Prerequisites:
-----------
Requires Python 3.7+.
https://www.python.org/getit/

Requires Pip.
https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/quickstart/

Quickstart:

1. Install Pipenv
```bash
$ pip install pipenv
```

2. Install required packages using Pipenv
```bash
$ pipenv install
```
This will create a virtual environment with all the required Python packages

3. Activate Pipenv environment
```bash
$ pipenv shell
```

3. Run Cell Universe on an example video (look inside the `run.sh` script to see the command used).
```bash
$ cd examples/canonical && ./run.sh
```
similarly for video 1, 2, 3 (in `run.sh` you can change the starting and ending frame)
```bash
$ cd examples/video1 && ./run.sh
```

-----------
Alternative:

1. (Optional) Create a Python 3 virtual environment.
```bash
$ pip3 install virtualenv
$ virtualenv -p python3 venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
```
2. Install the requirements.
```bash
(venv)$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run Cell Universe on an example video (look inside the `run.sh` script to see the command used).
```bash
(venv)$ cd examples/canonical && ./run.sh
```
similarly for video 1, 2, 3 (in `run.sh` you can change the starting and ending frame)
```bash
(venv)$ cd examples/video1 && ./run.sh
```

Steps to get a new video running:
---------------------------------
1. Separate your video into still images, one PNG image per frame and put them in a directory with chronological names like `frame000.png`, `frame001.png`, etc. (We have a script to do this called XXXXX, but there also exist websites that can do this such as XXXXX.)
2. There are two orthogonal things that need to be initialized: (a) an accurate STATIC picture of the number, location, size, and orientation of all the cells in Frame 000, and (b) the values of DYNAMIC parameters that control things like how fast cells can move per frame, how much they can rotate, grow in length, and importantly, their split rate per frame (ie., the probability that a parent cell will split into two daughter cells).

2a. The state of the system at Frame 000 can be composed visually using our cell labeling tool Python program (PUT A LINK HERE TO THE LABELER IN THE REPO). This will create a CSV file with all that information. See the `tools/cell_labeling_tool/README.md` for more information about the cell labeling tool and `examples/canonical/initial.csv` for an example initial properties file generated by the cell labeling tool.
```bash
(venv)$ python3 tools/cell_labeling_tool/cell_labeling_tool.py
```
2b. Create a Cell Universe config file and fill it in with settings that fits your cell video. See `examples/canonical/global_optimizer_config.json` (and the comments in the file) and other config JSON files in the `examples` directory for examples.
    * It is important to change settings in the config file like the "Global Setttings" and the "Bacilli Settings" to match your cell video, or else Cell Universe will not function properly.
    
3. Run Cell Universe, giving it the input directory containing the frames, the initial properties file created above, the config file, as well as the other required arguments (see in the Usage section).
    * An example command is at the bottom of this README and more in the `run.sh` script files in the `examples` directory.

There are several examples in subdirectories below the directory `regression-tests` and `examples`.

--------
Guide of running the examples
-----
There are currently four running examples located in the example folders. Each example is packed into a folder, which consists the input images, the initial cell configuration file, the configuration files, and the scripts to run the example. The scripts doesn't do anything magic. It's simply a wrapper of the command to run the program.

To run the examples:

Step 1: Activate the python environment. To do this, first locate to the root directory of this project, and run
```
pipenv shell
```

Step 2: Move to the folder consists the example that you want to run. Here, use the canonical one as an example.
```
cd examples/canonical
```
Step 3: Use the script to run the example

For Windows Users (Powershell):
```
.\run.ps1
```
For Linux Users (Bash):
```
.\run.sh
```

Step 4: Wait until the program finish. The output is located in the output folder in the example folder.
